# 📊 Flipkart Product Review Analysis

This project performs text analysis and preprocessing on customer reviews collected from Flipkart to gain insights into product sentiments. The notebook walks through the steps of cleaning review text, removing stopwords, and preparing data for further sentiment or machine learning analysis.

## 🧠 Features

- Text cleaning (punctuation, special characters, URLs, digits)
- Stopword removal using NLTK
- Stemming using `SnowballStemmer`
- Handling null values in the dataset
- Ready for integration into a sentiment analysis pipeline

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Flipcart_Analysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and text preprocessing steps.
- `data/` *(optional)*: Directory where raw or cleaned data can be stored.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Regular Expressions (re)

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vanshikaathakur/Flipcart_Analysis.gitcd Flipcart_Analysis

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows

3. Install the required packages:

bash
pip install pandas nltk

4.Run the notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook Flipcart_Analysis.ipynb


📌 Notes
The dataset is assumed to contain columns like Product_name, Review, and Rating.

You must have internet access the first time you run it to download NLTK stopwords:

nltk.download('stopwords')
